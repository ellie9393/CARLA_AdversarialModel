I added a Reckless class to the behavior_type code, 
then modified generate_traffic.py to spawn 15 reckless agents.

After that, I attached a collision sensor and let them run for 1 minute to collect data. 
The simulation logs vehicle collisions, speed, and movement, outputting data in Reckless_Vehicle_metrics.csv for further analysis.

The generated plots compare normal agents and reckless agents.
However, it appears that reckless agents, by colliding with normal agents, have also increased the number of collisions for normal agents. 
To prevent excessive logging of repeated collisions, I implemented a cooldown period to avoid logging too many crashes from minor or repeated contacts.
